Before starting any work on this project, READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

## Project Structure
- **Single Next.js app** in `mile-sync-app/` directory
- **Uses Vercel API routes** (NOT separate Express backend)

- ✅ Package.json and dependencies are set up

## Before Making ANY Changes:
1. **ALWAYS read existing files first** (README.md, package.json, .env files)
2. **Check current project structure** with `list_dir` or `glob_file_search`
3. **Look for existing configuration** before suggesting new setup
4. **Never assume we need to start from scratch**

## Common Tasks Already Done:
- Environment file creation
- Project structure setup
- Package.json configuration

## Remember:
- User has already done most setup work
- Don't repeat completed tasks
- Always check existing state before suggesting new actions
