# AI Workflow Checklist for MileSync

## Before Every Session:
- [ ] Read `.ai-instructions.md`
- [ ] Check project structure with `list_dir` or `glob_file_search`
- [ ] Read existing configuration files (package.json, .env files, README.md)
- [ ] Verify current state before suggesting changes

## When User Asks About Setup:
1. **First**: Check if files already exist
2. **Second**: Read existing configuration
3. **Third**: Only suggest what's actually missing
4. **Never**: Assume we need to start over

## File Check Order:
1. README.md (project overview)
2. package.json (dependencies)
3. .env files (configuration)
4. Existing code structure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Suggesting to create files that already exist
- ❌ Assuming separate backend/frontend structure
- ❌ Not reading existing configuration first
- ❌ Starting from scratch when work is already done

## Success Pattern:
- ✅ Read existing files first
- ✅ Build on existing work
- ✅ Only suggest what's actually needed
- ✅ Be efficient and respectful of previous work
